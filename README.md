# Vehicle-Price-Prediction
Vehicle Price prediction is a Regression project. In this project we are going to vehicle price based vehicle data like engine capacity, length , horsepower, manufacture etc. In this project  are 5 steps. First step is loading vehicle data into notebook. Next step is cleaning  the data which involves removing rows NAN or fill NAN with mean strategy.In this project we have converted text data to number data using dictionary maping technique.After cleaning the data we have split the data into traning and testing sets in 70-30 proportion
Algorithm: In this project we have used Redge Algorithm,linear algorithm,lasso algorithm.
Conclusion: In this project  Iam recommending ridge algorithm because it is having more accuracy 80%
